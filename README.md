# comfyui-pixel-art-doctor
A ComfyUI custom node that intelligently downscales 'fake' pixel art to its true, native resolution.  This node is the perfect tool for cleaning up pixel art that has been resized, has anti-aliasing, or contains compression artifacts. It automatically detects the grid size and resamples the image for a perfectly sharp, 1:1 pixel result.
